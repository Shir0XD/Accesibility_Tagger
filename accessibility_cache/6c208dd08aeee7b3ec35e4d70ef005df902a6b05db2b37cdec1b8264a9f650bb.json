  "summary": "The provided text fragment, 'In this Agreement, words and expression shall assume the same meanings as are respectively', does not constitute a discernible list. It appears to be an incomplete sentence or an introductory clause within a legal document, likely preceding a section that defines terms. There are no visual or structural cues (like bullets, numbers, or distinct line breaks) to indicate it is a list.",

  "description": "This content is presented as a continuous string of text without any list-specific formatting or markers. For WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, this content should not be tagged as a list. Instead, it should be treated as a paragraph (<P> tag in PDF) or a part of a larger text block. Screen readers would interpret this as a single, continuous sentence. Tagging it as a list would be semantically incorrect and could confuse users of assistive technologies, as they would expect distinct list items that are not present. Therefore, no individual list items can be extracted or described."
